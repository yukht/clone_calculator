# Calculon - A desktop calculator in PyQt

A simple calculator application implemented in Python using PyQt. The UI was designed in Qt Designer and the
calculator operations are implemented using simple stack-based logic.

## Getting started

To use each app you first need to install the requirements. In most cases
the only requirements are PyQt5, and occasionally requests. To install
app-specific requirements change to the folder of the app and run:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    
Once the requirements are installed, you can run the app using Python 3.

    python3 <filename>.py
 
The application window should appear.

## Want to build your own apps?

> If you think these apps are neat and want to learn more about
PyQt in general, take a look at my [PyQt5 tutorial](https://www.learnpyqt.com)
which covers everything you need to know to start building your own applications with PyQt.

You can also find write-ups about these "minute apps" [on the same site](http://www.learnpyqt.com/apps).
